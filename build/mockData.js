        keywords: ["leaky faucet", "dripping faucet", "faucet drip", "faucet leak", "fix drip"],
        answer: "A dripping faucet is usually caused by a worn-out washer, O-ring, or cartridge. For a basic compression faucet, you can often DIY it: turn off the water supply under the sink, disassemble the handle, replace the washer or O-ring (~$5–$10 at a hardware store), and reassemble. For ball, cartridge, or ceramic disc faucets, the repair is slightly more involved but still doable. If the drip persists after replacing parts, or if you see corrosion on the valve seat, it's worth calling a plumber. A plumber typically charges $75–$200 for a faucet repair.",

        answer: "Water heaters typically last 8–12 years for tank models and 20+ years for tankless. Signs you need replacement: rusty water, rumbling noises, water pooling around the base, or consistently lukewarm water. Tank water heaters cost $500–$1,500 installed; tankless units run $1,000–$3,500 installed but can reduce energy bills by 20–30%. Water heater installation requires permits in most jurisdictions and should be done by a licensed plumber. Get at least 2–3 quotes — prices vary significantly.",

        answer: "A frequently tripping breaker signals one of three issues: (1) an overloaded circuit — too many devices drawing power at once; (2) a short circuit — a hot wire touching a neutral wire, often from damaged wiring; or (3) a ground fault. Overloads can sometimes be fixed by redistributing devices to different circuits. Short circuits and ground faults require a licensed electrician — these are fire hazards. Never tape or block a breaker in the 'on' position. If a breaker trips repeatedly or you smell burning, call an electrician immediately.",

        keywords: ["ac not cooling", "air conditioner", "ac not working", "warm air", "hvac", "central air"],
        answer: "Start with the basics: (1) Check the thermostat is set to 'cool' and the temperature is below room temp. (2) Replace the air filter if it's been more than 60–90 days — a clogged filter is the #1 cause of AC problems. (3) Check that the outdoor unit isn't blocked by debris and the fins are clean. (4) Make sure supply vents are open and not blocked by furniture. If the unit is running but still blowing warm air, the refrigerant may be low (a sign of a leak) or the compressor may be failing — both require a certified HVAC technician. Typical AC service call: $75–$150; refrigerant recharge: $200–$400.",

        answer: "Bathroom remodel costs vary widely by scope: a cosmetic refresh (new fixtures, paint, accessories) runs $1,500–$5,000; a mid-range remodel (new tile, vanity, tub/shower surround) typically costs $8,000–$20,000; a high-end gut renovation can reach $30,000–$60,000+. Key cost drivers are tile labor (very time-intensive), moving plumbing or electrical, and the quality of fixtures. Budget ~10–20% contingency for surprises like water damage or outdated wiring behind walls. Getting 3+ quotes from licensed contractors is strongly recommended for projects over $5,000.",

        topic: "roof repair or replace",
        keywords: ["roof leak", "roof repair", "roof replacement", "shingles", "roofing"],
        answer: "Whether to repair or replace depends on the roof's age and the extent of damage. If your asphalt shingle roof is under 15 years old and damage is localized (a few shingles, small leak), repair usually makes sense ($300–$1,500). If it's 20+ years old, has widespread granule loss, multiple leaks, or sagging, replacement is more cost-effective long-term. A full asphalt shingle replacement typically costs $8,000–$20,000 for an average home. Always get a professional inspection before deciding — many roofers offer free estimates. Look for Angi Certified pros who are licensed, insured, and carry workmanship warranties.",

        answer: "For minor clogs: (1) Try a plunger first — it works on most sink and tub clogs. (2) Use a drain snake/auger for deeper clogs. (3) A baking soda + vinegar flush (followed by hot water) can break up grease buildup. Avoid chemical drain cleaners regularly — they corrode pipes over time. For recurring or stubborn clogs, a plumber can use a hydro-jet to clear the line completely (~$300–$600). Main sewer line clogs (all drains slow at once, gurgling toilets) are a plumbing emergency — call a pro immediately.",

        answer: "Kitchen remodels are the #1 home improvement investment. A minor refresh (cabinet paint, new hardware, countertop resurfacing) runs $5,000–$15,000. A mid-range remodel with semi-custom cabinets, new countertops, and appliance upgrades typically costs $25,000–$60,000. A full high-end renovation with custom cabinetry, premium appliances, and layout changes can exceed $100,000. On average, homeowners recoup 60–80% of kitchen remodel costs at resale. The biggest cost items are cabinetry (30–40% of budget), labor, and countertops.",
